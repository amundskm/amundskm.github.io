          <p class="workExperience">
            Using functional programming in VBA to write excel macros, developed an application to automate a
            procedure documentation process. After implementing the application as standard operating procedure,
            five technicians were able to reduce total process time by 60 minutes per project.
            Wrote an application to verify SQL bill of materials versus work instruction bill of materials. By
            automating the process, the project was completed 3 weeks ahead of schedule.
            Collaborated with 3 other design engineers to produce new products for the recreational vehicle
            market. Met with direct customers, suppliers and end users to understand project parameters, and
            communicate project progress through the development process. From this process, we were able to
            improve a supplierâ€™s turn around time on parts by improving our engineering drawing requirements.
